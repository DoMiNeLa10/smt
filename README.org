#+TITLE: smt - disable and enable SMT on the fly

This script provides a convienient way to disable and enable SMT (known as
HyperThreading on Intel chips) on the fly. This allows to turn off SMT when
desired to improve security on Intel chips ([[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreshadow_(security_vulnerability)][L1TF]] and [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microarchitectural_Data_Sampling][MDS]] can't be fully
mitigated without disabling HT).

This script uses sysfs, and will work only with the Linux kernel. It's written
in GNU Bash, and uses ~nproc~, which might not be available in non-GNU
coreutils.

* Installation
Put the =smt= file from this repository somewhere in your ~PATH~. Since this
scipt requires root access, you might want to setuid it.

* Usage
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  smt [on|off]
#+END_SRC
